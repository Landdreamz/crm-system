# Fix 404 — Enable GitHub Pages for CRM

Your app is built and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch. GitHub just needs to be told to publish it.

## Steps (about 30 seconds)

1. **Open your repo’s Pages settings**  
   → **https://github.com/Landdreamz/crm-system/settings/pages**

2. Under **“Build and deployment”** → **“Source”**, choose **“Deploy from a branch”**.

3. Under **“Branch”**:
   - Select **`gh-pages`**
   - Folder: **`/ (root)`**
   - Click **Save**.

4. Wait 1–2 minutes. Your CRM will be live at:  
   **https://landdreamz.github.io/crm-system/**

If it still shows 404 after a few minutes, refresh the page or try in an incognito window.
